# Practicing what we have already learned

> And now, a taste of things to come!
>
>  -- Shang Tsung, Mortal Kombat The Movie

The above quote took place just before a [fighting scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0vhGEGJC8g) in which a nameless warrior jumped at Sub-Zero only to be frozen and broken into multiple pieces upon hitting the wall. The scene was not spectacular in terms of fighting technique or length. Also, the nameless guy didn't even try hard -- the only thing he did was to jump only to be hit by a freezing ball, which, by the way, he actually could see coming. It looked a lot like the fight was set up only to showcase Sub-Zero's freezing ability. Guess what? In this chapter, we're ging to do roughly the same thing -- set up a fake, easy scenario just to showcase some of the basic TDD elements!

The previous chapter was filled with a lot of theory and philosophy, don't you think? I hope you didn't fall asleep while reading it. To tell you the truth, we need to grasp much more theory until we can write real-world applications using TDD. To compensate for this somehow, I propose we take a side trip from the trail and try what we already learned in a quick and easy example. As we go through the example, you might wonder how on earth could you possibly write real applications the way we will write our simple program. Don't worry, I will not show you all the tricks yet, so treat it as a "taste of things to come". In other words, the example will be as close to real-world problems as the fight between Sub-Zero and the nameless ninja was to real martial arts fight, but will show you some of the elements of the TDD process.

## Let me tell you a story 

Meet Johnny and Benjamin, two developers from Buthig Company. Johnny is quite fluent in programming and Test-Driven Development, while Benjamin is an intern under Johnny's mentorship and is eager to learn TDD. They are on their way to their customer, Jane, who requested their presence as she wants them to write a small program for her. Along with them, we will see how they interact with the customer and how Benjamin tries to understand the basics of TDD. Like you, Benjamin is a novice so his questions may reflect yours. However, if you find anything explained in not enough detail, do not worry -- in the next chapters, we will be expanding on this material.

## Act 1: The Car

**Johnny:** How do you feel about your first assignment?

**Benjamin:** I am pretty excited! I hope I can learn some of the TDD stuff you promised to teach me.

**Johnny:** Not only TDD, but we are also gonna use some of the practices associated with a process called Acceptance Test-Driven Development, albeit in a simplified form.

**Benjamin:** Acceptance Test-Driven Development? What is that?

**Johnny:** While TDD is usually referred to as a development technique, Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) is something more of a collaboration method. Both ATDD and TDD have a bit of analysis in them and work very well together as both use the same underlying principles, just on different levels. We will need only a small subset of what ATDD has to offer, so don't get over-excited.

**Benjamin:** Sure. Who's our customer?

**Johnny:** Her name's Jane. She runs a small shop nearby and wants us to write an application for her new mobile. You'll get the chance to meet her in a minute as we're almost there.

## Act 2: The Customer's Site

**Johnny:** Hi, Jane, how are you?

**Jane:** Thanks, I'm fine, how about you?

**Johnny:** Me too, thanks. Benjamin, this is Jane, our customer. Jane, this is Benjamin, we'll work together on the task you have for us. 

**Benjamin:** Hi, nice to meet you.

**Jane:** Hello, nice to meet you too.

**Johnny:** So, can you tell us a bit about the software you need us to write?

**Jane:** Sure. Recently, I bought a new smartphone as a replacement for my old one. The thing is, I am really used to the calculator application that ran on my previous phone and I cannot find a counterpart for my current device.

**Benjamin:** Can't you just use another calculator app? There are probably plenty of them available to download from the web.

**Jane:** That's right. I checked them all and none has the same behavior as the one I have used for my tax calculations. You see, this app was like a right hand to me and it had some nice shortcuts that made my life easier.

**Johnny:** So you want us to reproduce the application to run on your new device?

**Jane:** Exactly.

**Johnny:** Are you aware that apart from the fancy features that you were using we will have to allocate some effort to implement the basics that all the calculators have?

**Jane:** Sure, I am OK with that. I got used to my calculator application so much that if I use something else for more than a few months, I will have to pay a psychotherapist instead of you guys. Apart from that, writing a calculator app seems like an easy task in my mind, so the cost isn't going to be overwhelming, right?

**Johnny:** I think I get it. Let's get it going then. We will be implementing the functionality incrementally, starting with the most essential features. Which feature of the calculator would you consider the most essential?

**Jane:** That would be the addition of numbers, I guess.

**Johnny:** Ok, that will be our target for the first iteration. After the iteration, we will deliver this part of the functionality for you to try out and give us some feedback. However, before we can even deliver the addition feature, we will have to implement displaying digits on the screen as you enter them. Is that correct?

**Jane:** Yes, I need the display stuff to work as well -- it's a prerequisite for other features, so...

**Johnny:** Ok then, this is a simple functionality, so let me suggest some user stories as I understand what you already said and you will correct me where I am wrong. Here we go:

1. **In order to** know that the calculator is turned on, **As a** taxpayer **I want** to see "0" on the screen as soon as I turn it on.
1. **In order to** see what numbers I am currently operating on, **As a** taxpayer, **I want** the calculator to display the values I enter
1. **In order to** calculate the sum of my different incomes, **As a** taxpayer **I want** the calculator to enable addition of multiple numbers

What do you think?

**Jane**: The stories pretty much reflect what I want for the first iteration. I don't think I have any corrections to make.

**Johnny:** Now we'll take each story and collect some examples of how it should work.

**Benjamin:** Johnny, don't you think it is obvious enough to proceed with implementation straight away?

**Johnny:** Trust me, Benjamin, if there is one word I fear most in communication, it is "obvious". Miscommunication happens most often around things that people consider obvious, simply because other people do not.

**Jane:** Ok, I'm in. What do I do?

**Johnny:** Let's go through the stories one by one and see if we can find some key examples of how the features should work. The first story is...

### **In order to** know that the calculator is turned on, **As a** taxpayer **I want** to see "0" on the screen as soon as I turn it on.

**Jane:** I don't think there's much to talk about. If you display "0", I will be happy. That's all.

**Johnny:** Let's write this example down using a table:

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                   |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| N/A          | 0                | Initial displayed value |

**Benjamin:** That makes me wonder... what should happen when I press "0" again at this stage?

**Johnny:** Good catch, that's what these examples are for -- they make our thinking concrete. As Ken Pugh says[^prefactoring]: "Often the complete understanding of a concept does not occur until someone tries to use the concept". Normally, we would put the "pressing zero multiple times" example on a TODO list and leave it for later, because it's a part of a different story. However, it looks like we're done with the current story, so let's move straight ahead. The next story is about displaying entered digits. How about it, Jane?

**Jane:** Agree.

**Johnny:** Benjamin?

**Benjamin:** Yes, go ahead.

### **In order to** see what numbers I am currently operating on, **As a** taxpayer, **I want** the calculator to display the values I enter

**Johnny:** Let's begin with the case raised by Benjamin. What should happen when I input "0" multiple times after I only have "0" on the display?

**Jane:** A single "0" should be displayed, no matter how many times I press "0".

**Johnny:** Do you mean this?

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                                              |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 0,0,0        | 0                | Zero is a special case – it is displayed only once |

**Jane:** That's right. Other than this, the digits should just show on the screen, like this:

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                        |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| 1,2,3        | 123              | Entered digits are displayed |

**Benjamin:** How about this:

| key sequence               | Displayed output | Notes                         |
|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,1,2,3,4,5,6  | 1234567123456?   | Entered digits are displayed? |

**Jane:** Actually, no. My old calculator app has a limit of six digits that I can enter, so it should be:

| key sequence              | Displayed output  | Notes                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,1,2,3,4,5,6 | 123456            | Display limited to six digits |

**Johnny:** Another good catch, Benjamin!

**Benjamin:** I think I'm beginning to understand why you like working with examples!

**Johnny:** Good. Is there anything else, Jane?

**Jane:** No, that's pretty much it. Let's start working on another story.

### **In order to** calculate the sum of my different incomes, **As a** taxpayer **I want** the calculator to enable addition of multiple numbers

**Johnny:** Is the following scenario the only one we have to support?

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                      |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| 2,+,3,+,4,=  | 9                | Simple addition of numbers |

**Jane:** This scenario is correct, however, there is also a case when I start with "+" without inputting any number before. This should be treated as adding to zero:

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                              |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| +,1,=        | 1                | Addition shortcut – treated as 0+1 |

**Benjamin:** How about when the output is a number longer than six digits limit? Is it OK that we truncate it like this?

| key sequence                | Displayed output | Notes                                     |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 9,9,9,9,9,9,+,9,9,9,9,9,9,= | 199999           | Our display is limited to six digits only |

**Jane:** Sure, I don't mind. I don't add such big numbers anyway.

**Johnny:** There is still one question we missed. Let's say that I input a number, then press "+" and then another number without asking for result with "=". What should I see?

**Jane:** Every time you press "+", the calculator should consider entering current number finished and overwrite it as soon as you press any other digit:

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                                                                                             |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2,+,3        | 3                | Digits entered after + operator are treated as digits of a new number, the previous one is stored |

**Jane:** Oh, and asking for the result just after the calculator is turned on should result in "0".

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                             |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| =            | 0                | Result key in itself does nothing |

**Johnny:** Let's sum up our discoveries:

| key sequence                | Displayed output | Notes    |
|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| N/A                         | 0                | Initial displayed value                                                                           |
| 1,2,3                       | 123              | Entered digits are displayed                                                                      |
| 0,0,0                       | 0                | Zero is a special case – it is displayed only once                                                |
| 1,2,3,4,5,6,7               | 123456           | Our display is limited to six digits only                                                         |
| 2,+,3                       | 3                | Digits entered after + operator are treated as digits of a new number, the previous one is stored |
| =                           | 0                | Result key in itself does nothing                                                                 |
| +,1,=                       | 1                | Addition shortcut – treated as 0+1                                                                |
| 2,+,3,+,4,=                 | 9                | Simple addition of numbers                                                                        |
| 9,9,9,9,9,9,+,9,9,9,9,9,9,= | 199999           | Our display is limited to six digits only                                                         |

**Johnny:** The limiting of digits displayed looks like a whole new feature, so I suggest we add it to the backlog and do it in another sprint. In this sprint, we will not handle such a situation at all. How about that, Jane?

**Jane:** Fine with me. It looks like a lot of work. Nice that we discovered it up-front. For me, the limiting capability seemed so obvious that I didn't even think it would be worth mentioning.

**Johnny:** See? That's why I don't like the word "obvious". Jane, we will get back to you if any more questions arise. For now, I think we know enough to implement these three stories for you.

**Jane:** good luck!

## Act 3: Test-Driven Development

**Benjamin:** Wow, that was cool. Was that Acceptance Test-Driven Development?

**Johnny:** In a greatly simplified version, yes. The reason I took you with me was to show you the similarities between working with the customer the way we did and working with the code using TDD process. They are both applying the same set of principles, just on different levels.

**Benjamin:** I'm dying to see it with my own eyes. Shall we start?

**Johnny:** Sure. If we followed the ATDD process, we would start writing what we call acceptance-level specification. In our case, however, a unit-level specification will be enough. Let's take the first example:

### Statement 1: Calculator should display 0 on creation

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                   |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| N/A          | 0                | Initial displayed value |

**Johnny:** Benjamin, try to write the first Statement.

**Benjamin:** Oh boy, I don't know how to start.

**Johnny:** Start by writing the statement in plain English. What should the calculator do?

**Benjamin:** It should display "0" when I turn the application on.

**Johnny:** In our case, "turning on" is creating a calculator. Let's write it down as a method name:

```csharp
public class CalculatorSpecification
{

[Fact] public void
ShouldDisplay0WhenCreated()
{

}

}
```

**Benjamin:** Why is the name of the class `CalculatorSpecification` and the name of the method `ShouldDisplay0WhenCreated`?

**Johnny:** It is a naming convention. There are many others, but this is the one that I like. In this convention, the rule is that when you take the name of the class without the `Specification` part followed by the name of the method, it should form a legit sentence. For instance, if I apply it to what we wrote, it would make a sentence: "Calculator should display 0 when created".

**Benjamin:** Ah, I see now. So it's a statement of behavior, isn't it?

**Johnny:** That's right. Now, the second trick I can sell to you is that if you don't know what code to start your Statement with, start with the expected result. In our case, we are expecting that the behavior will end up as displaying "0", right? So let's just write it in the form of an assertion.

**Benjamin:** You mean something like this?

```csharp
public class CalculatorSpecification
{

[Fact] public void
ShouldDisplay0WhenCreated()
{
 Assert.Equal("0", displayedResult);
}

}
```

**Johnny:** Precisely.

**Benjamin:** But that doesn't even compile. What use is it?

**Johnny:** The code not compiling is the feedback that you needed to proceed. While before you didn't know where to start, now you have a clear goal -- make this code compile. Firstly, where do you get the displayed value from?

**Benjamin:** From the calculator display, of course!

**Johnny:** Then write down how you get the value from the display.

**Benjamin:** Like how?

**Johnny:** Like this:

```csharp
public class CalculatorSpecification
{

[Fact] public void
ShouldDisplay0WhenCreated()
{
 var displayedResult = calculator.Display();

 Assert.Equal("0", displayedResult);
}

}
```

**Benjamin:** I see. Now the calculator is not created anywhere. I need to create it somewhere now or it will not compile - this is how I know that it's my next step. Is this how it works?

**Johnny:** Yes, you are catching on quickly.

**Benjamin:** Ok then, here goes:

```csharp
public class CalculatorSpecification
{

[Fact] public void
ShouldDisplay0WhenCreated()
{
 var calculator = new Calculator();

 var displayedResult = calculator.Display();

 Assert.Equal("0", displayedResult);
}

}
```

**Johnny:** Bravo!

**Benjamin:** The code doesn't compile yet, because I don't have the `Calculator` class defined at all...

**Johnny:** Sounds like a good reason to create it.

**Benjamin:** OK.

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
}
```

**Benjamin:** Looks like the `Display()` method is missing too. I'll add it.

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
  public string Display()
  {
    return "0";
  } 
}
```

**Johnny:** Hey hey, not so fast!

**Benjamin:** What?

**Johnny:** You already provided an implementation of `Display()` that will make our current Statement true. Remember its name? `ShouldDisplay0WhenCreated` -- and that's exactly what the code you wrote does. Before we arrive at this point, let's make sure this Statement can ever be evaluated as false. You won't achieve this by providing a correct implementation out of the box. So for now, let's change it to this:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
  public string Display()
  {
    return "Once upon a time in Africa";
  } 
}
```

**Johnny:** Look, now we can run the Specification and watch that Statement evaluate to false, because it expects "0", but gets "Once upon a time in Africa".

**Benjamin:** Running... Ok, it is false. By the way, do you always use such silly values to make Statements false?

**Johnny:** Hahaha, no, I just did it to emphasize the point. Normally, I would write `return "";` or something similarly simple. Now we can evaluate the Statement and see it turn false. Hence, we're sure that we have not yet implemented what is required for the Statement to be true.

**Benjamin:** I think I get it. For now, the Statement shows that we do not have something we need and gives us a reason to add this "thing". When we do so, this Statement will show that we do have what we need. So what do we do now?

**Johnny:** Write the simplest thing that makes this Statement true.

**Benjamin:** like this?

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
  public string Display()
  {
    return "0";
  } 
}
```

**Johnny:** Yes.

**Benjamin:** But that is not a real implementation. What is the value behind putting in a hardcoded string? The final implementation is not going to be like this for sure!

**Johnny:** You're right. The final implementation is most probably going to be different. What we did, however, is still valuable because:

1. You're one step closer to implementing the final solution
1. This feeling that this is not the final implementation points you towards writing more Statements. When there are enough Statements to make your implementation complete, it usually means that you have a complete Specification of class behaviors as well.
1. If you treat making every Statement true as an achievement, this practice allows you to evolve your code without losing what you already achieved. If by accident you break any of the behaviors you've already implemented, the Specification is going to tell you because one of the existing Statements that were previously true will turn false. You can then either fix it or undo your changes using version control and start over from the point where all existing Statements were true.

**Benjamin:** Ok, so it looks like there are some benefits after all. Still, I'll have to get used to this way of working.

**Johnny:** Don't worry, this approach is an important part of TDD, so you will grasp it in no time. Now, before we go ahead with the next Statement, let's look at what we already achieved. First, we wrote a Statement that turned out false. Then, we wrote just enough code to make the Statement true. Time for a step called Refactoring. In this step, we will take a look at the Statement and the code and remove duplication. Can you see what is duplicated between the Statement and the code?

**Benjamin:** both of them contain the literal "0". The Statement has it here:

```csharp
Assert.Equal("0", displayedResult);
```

and the implementation here:

```csharp
return "0";
```

**Johnny:** Good, let's eliminate this duplication by introducing a constant called `InitialValue`. The Statement will now look like this:

```csharp
[Fact] public void
ShouldDisplayInitialValueWhenCreated()
{
 var calculator = new Calculator();

 var displayedResult = calculator.Display();

 Assert.Equal(Calculator.InitialValue, displayedResult);
}
```

and the implementation:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
  public const string InitialValue = "0";
  public string Display()
  {
    return InitialValue;
  } 
}
```



**Benjamin:** The code looks better and having the "0" constant in one place will make it more maintainable. However, I think the Statement in its current form is weaker than before. I mean, we can change the `InitialValue` to anything and the Statement will still be true since it does not state that this constant needs to have a value of "0".

**Johnny:** That's right. We need to add it to our TODO list to handle this case. Can you write it down?

**Benjamin:** Sure. I will write it as "TODO: 0 should be used as an initial value."

**Johnny:** Ok. We should handle it now, especially since it's part of the story we are currently implementing, but I will leave it for later just to show you the power of TODO list in TDD -- whatever is on the list, we can forget and get back to when we have nothing better to do. Our next item from the list is this:

### Statement 2: Calculator should display entered digits

| key sequence | Displayed output | Notes                        |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| 1,2,3        | 123              | Entered digits are displayed |

**Johnny:** Benjamin, can you come up with a Statement for this behavior?

**Benjamin:** I'll try. Here goes:

```csharp
[Fact] public void 
ShouldDisplayEnteredDigits()
{
  var calculator = new Calculator();
  
  calculator.Enter(1); 
  calculator.Enter(2);
  calculator.Enter(3);
  var displayedValue = calculator.Display();

  Assert.Equal("123", displayedValue);
}
```

**Johnny:** I see that you're learning fast. You got the parts about naming ans structuring a Statement right. There's one thing we will have to work on here though.

**Benjamin:** What is it?

**Johnny:** When we talked to Jane, we used examples with real values. These real values were extremely helpful in pinning down the corner cases and uncovering missing scenarios. They were easier to imagine as well, so they were a perfect suit for conversation. If we were automating these examples on the acceptance level, we would use those real values as well. When we write unit-level Statements, however, we use a different technique to get this kind of specification more abstract. First of all, let me enumerate the weaknesses of the approach you just used:

1. Making a method `Enter()` accept an integer value suggests that one can enter more than one digit at once, e.g. `calculator.Enter(123)`, which is not what we want. We could detect such cases and throw exceptions if the value is outside the 0-9 range, but there are better ways when we know we will only be supporting ten digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).
1. The Statement does not clearly show the relationship between input and output. Of course, in this simple case, it's pretty self-evident that the sum is a concatenation of entered digits. In general case, however, we don't want anyone reading our Specification in the future to have to guess such things.
1. The name of the Statement suggests that what you wrote is true for any value, while in reality, it's true only for digits other than "0" since the behavior for "0" is different (no matter how many times we enter "0", the result is just "0"). There are some good ways to communicate it.

Hence, I propose the following:

```csharp
[Fact] public void 
ShouldDisplayAllEnteredDigitsThatAreNotLeadingZeroes()
{
 //GIVEN
 var calculator = new Calculator();
 var nonZeroDigit = Any.Besides(DigitKeys.Zero);
 var anyDigit1 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();
 var anyDigit2 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();

 //WHEN
 calculator.Enter(nonZeroDigit);
 calculator.Enter(anyDigit1);
 calculator.Enter(anyDigit2);

 //THEN
 Assert.Equal(
  string.Format("{0}{1}{2}", 
   (int)nonZeroDigit, 
   (int)anyDigit1, 
   (int)anyDigit2
  ),
  calculator.Display()
 );
}

**Benjamin:** Johnny, I'm lost! Can you explain what's going on here?

**Johnny:** Sure, what do you want to know?

**Benjamin:** For instance, what is this `DigitKeys` type doing here?

**Johnny:** It is supposed to be an enumeration (note that it does not exist yet, we just assume that we have it) to hold all the possible digits a user can enter, which are from the range of 0-9. This is to ensure that the user will not write `calculator.Enter(123)`. Instead of allowing our users to enter any number and then detecting errors, we are giving them a choice from among only the valid values.

**Benjamin:** Now I get it. So how about the `Any.Besides()` and `Any.Of()`? What do they do?

**Johnny:** They are methods from a small utility library I'm using when writing unit-level Specifications. `Any.Besides()` returns any value from enumeration besides the one passed as an argument. Hence, the call `Any.Besides(DigitKeys.Zero)` means "any of the values contained in DigitKeys enumeration, but not DigitKeys.Zero".

The `Any.Of()` is simpler -- it just returns any value in an enumeration.

Note that by saying:

```csharp
 var nonZeroDigit = Any.Besides(DigitKeys.Zero);
 var anyDigit1 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();
 var anyDigit2 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();
```

I specify explicitly, that the first value entered must be other than "0" and that this constraint does not apply to the second digit, the third one and so on.

By the way, this technique of using generated values instead of literals has its own principles and constraints which you have to know to use it effectively. Let's leave this topic for now and I promise I'll give you a detailed lecture on it later. Agreed?

**Benjamin:** You better do, because for now, I feel a bit uneasy with generating the values -- it seems like the Statement we are writing is getting less deterministic this way. The last question -- what about those weird comments you put in the code? `GIVEN`? `WHEN`? `THEN`?

**Johnny:** Yes, this is a convention that I use, not only in writing, but in thinking as well. I like to think about every behavior in terms of three elements: assumptions (given), trigger (when) and expected result (then). Using the words, we can summarize the Statement we are writing in the following way: "**Given** a calculator, **when** I enter some digits, the first one being non-zero, **then** they should all be displayed in the order they were entered". This is also something that I will tell you more about later.

**Benjamin:** Sure, for now, I need just enough detail to be able to keep going -- we can talk about the principles, pros, and cons later. By the way, the following sequence of casts looks a little bit ugly:

```csharp
string.Format("{0}{1}{2}",
 (int)nonZeroDigit,
 (int)anyDigit1,
 (int)anyDigit2
)
```

**Johnny:** We will get back to it and make it "smarter" in a second after we make this statement true. For now, we need something obvious. Something we know works. Let's evaluate this Statement. What is the result?

**Benjamin:** Failed: expected "351", but was "0".

**Johnny:** Good, now let's write some code to make this Statement true. First, we're going to introduce an enumeration of digits. This enum will contain the digit we use in the Statement (which is `DigitKeys.Zero`) and some bogus values:

```csharp
public enum DigitKeys
{
 Zero = 0,
 TODO1, //TODO - bogus value for now
 TODO2, //TODO - bogus value for now
 TODO3, //TODO - bogus value for now
 TODO4, //TODO - bogus value for now
}
```

**Benjamin:** What's with all those bogus values? Shouldn't we correctly define values for all the digits we support?

**Johnny:** Nope, not yet. We still don't have a Statement that would say what digits are supported and which would make us add them, right?

**Benjamin:** You say you need a Statement for an element to be in an enum?

**Johnny:** This is a specification we are writing, remember? It should say somewhere which digits we support, shouldn't it?

**Benjamin:** It's difficult to agree with, I mean, I can see the values in the enum, should I really test for something when there's not complexity involved?

**Johnny:** Again, we're not only testing but also we're specifying. I will try to give you more arguments later. For now, just bear with me and note that when we get to specify the enum elements, adding such a Statement will be almost effortless.

**Benjamin:** OK.

**Johnny:** Now for the implementation. Just to remind you -- what we have so far looks like this:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
 public const string InitialValue = "0";
 public string Display()
 {
  return InitialValue;
 } 
}
```

This does not support displaying multiple digits yet (as we just proved, because the Statement saying they are supported turned out false). So let's change the code to handle this case:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
 public const string InitialValue = "0";
 private int _result = 0;

 public void Enter(DigitKeys digit)
 {
  _result *= 10;
  _result += (int)digit;
 }

 public string Display()
 {
  return _result.ToString();
 }
}
```

**Johnny:** Now the Statement is true so we can go back to it and make it a little bit prettier. Let's take a second look at it:

```csharp
[Fact] public void 
ShouldDisplayAllEnteredDigitsThatAreNotLeadingZeroes()
{
 //GIVEN
 var calculator = new Calculator();
 var nonZeroDigit = Any.Besides(DigitKeys.Zero);
 var anyDigit1 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();
 var anyDigit2 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();

 //WHEN
 calculator.Enter(nonZeroDigit);
 calculator.Enter(anyDigit1);
 calculator.Enter(anyDigit2);

 //THEN
 Assert.Equal(
  string.Format("{0}{1}{2}",
   (int)nonZeroDigit,
   (int)anyDigit1,
   (int)anyDigit2
  ),
  calculator.Display()
 );
}
```

**Johnny:** Remember you said that you don't like the part where `string.Format()` is used?

**Benjamin:** Yeah, it seems a bit unreadable.

**Johnny:** Let's extract this part into a utility method and make it more general -- we will need a way of constructing expected displayed output in many of our future Statements. Here is my go at this helper method:

```csharp
string StringConsistingOf(params DigitKeys[] digits)
{
 var result = string.Empty;

 foreach(var digit in digits)
 {
  result += (int)digit;
 }
 return result;
}
```

Note that this is more general as it supports any number of parameters. And the Statement after this extraction looks like this:

```csharp
[Fact] public void 
ShouldDisplayAllEnteredDigitsThatAreNotLeadingZeroes()
{
 //GIVEN
 var calculator = new Calculator();
 var nonZeroDigit = Any.Besides(DigitKeys.Zero);
 var anyDigit1 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();
 var anyDigit2 = Any.Of<DigitKeys>();

 //WHEN
 calculator.Enter(nonZeroDigit);
 calculator.Enter(anyDigit1);
 calculator.Enter(anyDigit2);

 //THEN
 Assert.Equal(
  StringConsistingOf(nonZeroDigit, anyDigit1, anyDigit2),
  calculator.Display()
 );
}
```

**Benjamin:** Looks better to me. The Statement is still evaluated as true, which means we got it right, didn't we?

**Johnny:** Not exactly. With moves such as this one, I like to be extra careful and double-check whether the Statement still describes the behavior accurately. To make sure that's still the case, let's comment out the body of the `Enter()` method and see if this Statement would still turn out false:

```csharp
public void Enter(DigitKeys digit)
{
 //_result *= 10;
 //_result += (int)digit; 
}
```

**Benjamin:** Running... Ok, it is false now. Expected "243", got "0".

**Johnny:** Good, now we're pretty sure it works OK. Let's uncomment the lines we just commented out and move forward.

**Benjamin:** But wait, there is one thing that troubles me.

**Johnny:** I think I know - I was wondering if you'd catch it. Go ahead.

**Benjamin:** What troubles me is these two lines:

```csharp
public const string InitialValue = "0";
private int _result = 0;
```

Isn't this a duplication? I mean, it's not exactly a code duplication, but in both lines, the value of `0` has the same intent. Shouldn't we remove this duplication somehow?

**Johnny:** Yes, let's do it. My preference would be to change the `InitialValue` to `int` instead of string and use that. But I can't do it in a single step as I have the two Statements depending on `InitialValue` being a string. if I just changed the type to `int`, I would break those tests as well as the implementation and I always want to be fixing one thing at a time.

**Benjamin:** So what do we do?

**Johnny:** Well, my first step would be to go to the Statements that use `InitialValue` and use a `ToString()` method there. For example, in the Statement `ShouldDisplayInitialValueWhenCreated()`, I have an assertion:

```csharp
Assert.Equal(Calculator.InitialValue, displayedResult);
```

which I can change to:

```csharp
Assert.Equal(Calculator.InitialValue.ToString(), displayedResult);
```

**Benjamin:** But calling `ToString()` on a `string` just returns the same value, what's the point?

**Johnny:** The point is to make the type of whatever's on the left side of `.ToString()` irrelevant. Then I will be able to change that type without breaking the Statement. The new implementation of `Calculator` class will look like this:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
 public const int InitialValue = 0;
 private int _result = InitialValue;

 public void Enter(DigitKeys digit)
 {
  _result *= 10;
  _result += (int)digit;
 }

 public string Display()
 {
  return _result.ToString();
 }
}
```

**Benjamin:** Oh, I see. And the Statements are still evaluated as true.

**Johnny:** Yes. Shall we take on another Statement?

### Statement 3: Calculator should display only one zero digit if it is the only entered digit even if it is entered multiple times 

**Johnny:** Benjamin, this should be easy for you, so go ahead and try it. It is really a variation of the previous Statement.

**Benjamin:** Let me try... ok, here it is:

```csharp
[Fact] public void 
ShouldDisplayOnlyOneZeroDigitWhenItIsTheOnlyEnteredDigitEvenIfItIsEnteredMultipleTimes()
{
 //GIVEN
 var calculator = new Calculator();

 //WHEN
 calculator.Enter(DigitKeys.Zero);
 calculator.Enter(DigitKeys.Zero);
 calculator.Enter(DigitKeys.Zero);

 //THEN
 Assert.Equal(
  StringConsistingOf(DigitKeys.Zero), 
  calculator.Display()
 );
}
```

**Johnny:** Good, you're learning fast! Let's evaluate this Statement.

**Benjamin:** It seems that our current code already fulfills the Statement. Should I try to comment-out some code to make sure this Statement can fail just like you did in the previous Statement?

**Johnny:** That would be a wise thing to do. When a Statement turns out true without requiring you to change any production code, it's always suspicious. Just like you said, we have to change production code for a second to force this Statement to become false, then undo this modification to make it true again. This isn't as obvious as previously, so let me do it. I will mark all the added lines with `//+` comment so that you can see them easily:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
 public const int InitialValue = 0;
 private int _result = InitialValue;
 string _fakeResult = "0"; //+

 public void Enter(DigitKeys digit)
 {
  _result *= 10;
  _result += (int)digit;
  if(digit == DigitKeys.Zero) //+
  {  //+
   _fakeResult += "0";  //+
  } //+
 }

 public string Display()
 {
  if(_result == 0)  //+
  {  //+
   return _fakeResult;  //+
  }  //+
  return _result.ToString();
 }
}
```

**Benjamin:** Wow, looks like a lot of code just to make the Statement false! Is it worth the hassle? We will undo this whole change in a second anyway...

**Johnny:** Depends on how confident you want to feel. I would say that it's usually worth it -- at least you know that you got everything right. It might seem like a lot of work, but it only took me about a minute to add this code and imagine you got it wrong and had to debug it on a production environment. Now *that* would be a waste of time.

**Benjamin:** Ok, I think I get it. Since we saw this Statement turn false, I will undo this change to make it true again.

**Johnny:** Sure.

## Epilogue

Time to leave Johnny and Benjamin, at least for now. I planned to make this chapter longer, and cover all the other operations, but I fear Ii would make it boring. You should have a feel of how the TDD cycle looks like, especially since Johnny and Benjamin had a lot of conversations on many other topics in the meantime. I will be revisiting these topics later in the book. For now, if you felt lost or unconvinced on any of the topics mentioned by Johnny, don't worry -- I don't expect you to be proficient with any of the techniques shown in this chapter just yet. The time will come for that.
