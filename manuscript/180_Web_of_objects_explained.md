# The need for mock objects

We already experienced mock objects in the chapter about tools, although at that point, I gave you an oversimplified and deceiving explanation of what a mock object is, promising that I will make up for it later. Now is the time.

Mock objects were made with a specific goal in mind. I hope that when you understand the real goal, you will probably understand the means to the goal far better.

In this chapter, we will explore the qualities of object-oriented design which make mock objects a viable tool.

## Composability... again!

In the two previous chapters, we followed Johnny and Benjamin in discovering the benefits of and prerequisites for composability of objects. Composability is the number one quality of the design we're after. After reading Johhny and Benjamin's story, you might have some questions regarding composability. Hopefully, they are among the ones answered in the next few chapters. Ready?
