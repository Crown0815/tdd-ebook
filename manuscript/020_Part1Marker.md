Without going much into advanced aspects, such as applying TDD to object-oriented systems where multiple objects collaborate (which is a topic of part 2), I introduce the basic TDD philosophy and practices. In terms of design, most of the examples will be about methods of a single object being exercised. The goal is to focus on the core of TDD before going into its specific applications and to slowly introduce some concepts in an easy to grasp manner. 

After reading part 1, you will be able to effectively develop classes that have no dependencies on other classes (and on operating system resources) using TDD.
