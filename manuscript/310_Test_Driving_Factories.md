# Test-driving factories

In this chapter, we join Johnny and Benjaminas they continue their outside-in TDD journey. In this chapter, they will take on test-driving a factory.

**Johnny:** What's nest on our TODO list?

**Benjamin:** There are two instances of `NotImplementedException`, both from factories that we introduced when implementing the last Statement.

This one is for creating instances of `ReservationInProgress` - remember? You gave it a bogus name on purpose.

```csharp
public class TodoReservationInProgressFactory : ReservationInProgressFactory
{
  public ReservationInProgress FreshInstance()
  {
   throw new NotImplementedException();
  }
}
```

**Johnny:** Oh, yeah that one...

**Benjamin:** and there is another one for creating commands - `TickerOfficeCommandFactory`:

```csharp
public class TicketOfficeCommandFactory : CommandFactory
{
  public ReservationCommand CreateNewReservationCommand(
    ReservationRequestDto requestDto,
    ReservationInProgress reservationInProgress)
  {
   throw new NotImplementedException();
  }
}
```

**Johnny:** Let's do this one.

**Benjamin:** Why this one?

Johnny: No big reason. I just want to dig into the domain logic as soon as possible.

Benjamin: Right. We don't have a Specification for this class, so let's create one.

```csharp
public class TicketOfficeCommandFactorySpecification
{

}
```

Johnny: Go on, I think you will be able to write this Statement mostly without my help.

Benjamin: The beginning looks easy. I'll add a new Statement which I don't know yet what I'm going to call.

```csharp
public class TicketOfficeCommandFactorySpecification
{
 [Fact]
 public void ShouldCreateXXXXXXXXX() //TODO rename
 {
  Assert.True(false);
 }
}
```

Now, as you've told me before, I already know the class I am testing: `TicketOfficeCommandFactory`. It implements an interface that I already used in the previous Statement, so it already has a method: `CreateNewReservationCommand`. I'll just create an instance of the class and call the method:

```csharp
public class TicketOfficeCommandFactorySpecification
{
 [Fact]
 public void ShouldCreateXXXXXXXXX() //TODO rename
 {
  //GIVEN
  var factory = new TicketOfficeCommandFactory();
  
  //WHEN
  factory.CreateNewReservationCommand();

  //THEN
  Assert.True(false);
 }
}
```

This doesn't compile, of course. Then I look at the signature of the `CreateNewReservationCommand` method and I see that it returns a command but also accepts two arguments:

```csharp
public class TicketOfficeCommandFactorySpecification
{
 [Fact]
 public void ShouldCreateXXXXXXXXX() //TODO rename
 {
  //GIVEN
  var factory = new TicketOfficeCommandFactory();
  
  //WHEN
  var command = factory.CreateNewReservationCommand(
    Any.Instance<ReservationRequestDto>(),
    Any.Instance<ReservationInProgress>());

  //THEN
  Assert.True(false);
 }
}
```

I used `Any.Instance<>()` to generate anonymous instances of both the DTO and the `ReservationInProgress`.

Johnny: That's exactly what I'd do. I'd only assign them to variables if I needed to use them somewhere else in the Statement.

Benjamin: The Statement compiles. I still have the assertion to write. What exactly should I assert? From the factory, I'm getting back a command, but it only has an `Execute()` method. Everything else is hidden.

Johnny: There isn't much we can check when specifying a factory behavior. In this case, we can only specify the expected type of the command.

Benjamin: Wait, isn't this already in the signature? Looking at the creation method, I can already see that the returned type is `ReservationCommand`... wait!

Johnny: I thought you'd notice that. `ReservationCommand` is an interface. But an object needs to have a concrete type and this type is what we need to specify in this Statement. We don't have this type yet. We are on the verge of discovering it, and when we do, some new items will be added to our TODO list.

Benjamin: I'll call the class `NewReservationComand` and modify my Statement to assert the type. Also, I think I know now how to name this Statement:

```csharp
public class TicketOfficeCommandFactorySpecification
{
 [Fact]
 public void ShouldCreateNewReservationCommandWhenRequested()
 {
  //GIVEN
  var factory = new TicketOfficeCommandFactory();
  
  //WHEN
  var command = factory.CreateNewReservationCommand(
    Any.Instance<ReservationRequestDto>(),
    Any.Instance<ReservationInProgress>());

  //THEN
  Assert.IsType<NewReservationCommand>(command);
 }
}
```

Johnny: Now, let's see - the Statement looks like it's complete. You did it almost without my help.

Benjamin: Thanks. The code does not compile, though. The `NewReservationCommand` type does not exist.

Johnny: Let's introduce it then:

```csharp
public class NewReservationCommand
{

}
```

Benjamin: Shouldn't it implement the `ReservationCommand` interface?

Johnny: We don't need to do that yet. The compiler only complained that the type doesn't exist.

Benjamin: The code compiles now, but the Statement is false because the `CreateNewReservationCommand` method throw a `NotImplementedException`:

```csharp
public ReservationCommand CreateNewReservationCommand(
    ReservationRequestDto requestDto,
    ReservationInProgress reservationInProgress)
  {
   throw new NotImplementedException();
  }
```

Johnny: Remember what I told you the last time?

Benjamin: Yes, that the Statement needs to be false for the right reason.

Johnny: Exactly. `NotImplementedException` is not the right reason. I will change the above code to return null:

```csharp
public ReservationCommand CreateNewReservationCommand(
    ReservationRequestDto requestDto,
    ReservationInProgress reservationInProgress)
  {
   return null;
  }
```

Now the Statement is false because this assertion fails:

```csharp
Assert.IsType<NewReservationCommand>(command);
```

Benjamin: it complains that the command is null.

Johnny: So the right time came to put in the correct implementation:

```csharp
public ReservationCommand CreateNewReservationCommand(
    ReservationRequestDto requestDto,
    ReservationInProgress reservationInProgress)
  {
   return new NewReservationCommand();
  }
```

Benjamin: But this doesn't compile -- the `NewReservationComand` doesn't implement the `ReservationCommand` interface, I told you this before.

Johnny: and the compiler forces us to implement this interface:

```csharp
public class NewReservationCommand : ReservationCommand
{

}
```

The code still doesn't compile, because the interface has some methods we need to implement in the `NewReservationComand`. Any implementation will do as these methods are outside the scope of the current Statement. We only want to make the compiler happy.




1. No refactoring
2. There will be no story slicing
3. No higher level tests

  {

The above does not compile yet as the `BookTicketCommand` does not implement a `Command` interface. Need to add it (can be done via quick fix):

+        this.reservation = reservation;
+        this.ticket = ticket;
+    }
```


(Question: why could we do so many steps? Should we not generate the constructor first and assign the field only when the test fails for the right reason? Probably no, since we already saw it failing for the right reason...)

The test now passes. New items on TODO list (e.g. Execute() method)


(btw, mention here that I tried to specify BookCommand and failed)

Added an item to TODO list - we'll get back to it later. if no coach allows up front, we take the first one that has the limit.

In the following changes, forced the right implementation. But need to refactor the tests. Next time we change this class, we refactor the code:

First we need to say we allow reservations. This dependency between tests is a sign of a design problem. Then, the method is long. Also, every time we set mock to return up front reservation, we need to set not upfront reservation and vice versa.  We could refactor this to chain of responsibility with two elements, but it's too early for that. We could also refactor to return a value object or enum for the kind of reservation. Or, we could use a collecting parameter, pass it through the list and make it do the reservation.

I change the first Statement to include the queries:
