# About code examples

## Notes for C# users

The language of choice for code examples is C#, however, I made some exception from the typical C# code conventions.

### Dropping "I" from interface names

I am not a big fan of using `ISomething` as an interface name, so I decided to drop the `I` even though most C# developers expect to see it. I hope you can forgive on this one.

### Idiomatic C\#

Most of the code in this book is not idiomatic C#. I tried to avoid properties, events, and most modern features. My goal is to allow users of other languages (especially Java) to benefit from the book.

### Using underscore in field names

Some people like it, some not. I decided to stick to the convention of putting an underscore (`_`) before a class field name.

## Notes for Java users

The language of choice for the code examples is C#. That said, I wanted the book to be as technology-agnostic as possible, to allow especially Java programmers to benefit from it. I tried using a minimum number of C#-specific features and in several places even made remarks targeted at Java users to make it easier for them. Still, there are some things I could not avoid. That's why I wrote up a list containing several of the differences between Java and C# that Java users could benefit from knowing when reading the book.

### Naming conventions

Most languages have their default naming conventions. For example, in Java, a class name is written with pascal case (e.g. `UserAccount`), methods and fields are written with camel case, e.g. `payTaxes` and constants/read-only fields are typically written in underscored upper-case (e.g. `CONNECTED_NODES`).

C# uses pascal case for both classes and methods (e.g. `UserAccount`, `PayTaxes`, `ConnectedNodes`). For fields, there are several naming conventions. I chose the one starting with underscore (e.g. `_myDependency`). There are other minor differences, but these are the ones you are going to encounter quite often.

### `var` keyword

For example brevity, I chose to use the `var` keyword in the examples. This keyword serves as automatic type inference, e.g.

```csharp
var x = 123; //x inferred as integer
```

Of course, this is no dynamic typing by any means -- everything is resolved at compile time.

One more thing -- `var` keyword can only be used when the type can be inferred, so occasionally, you will see me declaring types explicitly as in:

```csharp
List<string> list = null; //list cannot be inferred
```

### `string` as keyword

C# has a `String` type, similar to Java. It allows, however, to write this type name as keyword, e.g. `string` instead of `String`. This is only syntactic sugar which is used by default by the C# community.

### Attributes instead of annotations

In C#, attributes are used for the same purpose as annotations in Java. So, whenever you see:

```csharp
[Whatever]
public void doSomething()
```

think:

```java
@Whatever
public void doSomething()
```

### `readonly` and `const` instead of `final`

Where Java uses final for constants (together with `static`) and read-only fields, C# uses two keywords: `const` and `readonly`. Without going into details, whenever you see something like:

```csharp
public class User
{
  // a constant with literal:
  private const int DefaultAge = 15;

  // a "constant" object:
  private static readonly TimeSpan DefaultSessionTime
    = TimeSpan.FromDays(2);

  // a read-only instance field:
  private readonly List<int> _marks = new List<int>();
}
```

think:

```java
public class User {
  //a constant with literal:
  private static final int DEFAULT_AGE = 15; 

  //a "constant" object:
  private static final Duration 
    DEFAULT_SESSION_TIME = Duration.ofDays(2);

  // a read-only instance field:
  private final List<Integer> marks = new ArrayList<>();
}
```

### A `List<T>`

If you are a Java user, note that in C#, `List<T>` is not an interface, but a concrete class. it is typically used where you would use an `ArrayList`.

### Generics

One of the biggest difference between Java and C# is how they treat generics. First of all, C# allows using primitive types in generic declarations, so you can write `List<int>` in C# where in Java you have to write `List<Integer>`. 

The other difference is that in C# there is no type erasure as there is in Java. C# code retains all the generic information at runtime. This impacts how most generic APIs are declared and used in C#.

A generic class definition and creation in Java and C# are roughly the same. There is, however, a difference on a method level. A generic method in Java is typically written as:

```java
public <T> List<T> createArrayOf(Class<T> type) {
    ...
}
```

and called like this:

```java
List<Integer> ints = createArrayOf(Integer.class);
```

whereas in C# the same method would be defined as:

```java
public List<T> CreateArrayOf<T>()
{
    ...
}
```

and called as such:

```csharp
List<int> ints = CreateArrayOf<int>();
```

These differences are visible in the design of the library that I use throughout this book for generating test data. While in the C# version, one generates test data by writing:

```csharp
var data = Any.Instance<MyData>();
```

the Java version of the library is used like this:

```java
MyData data = Any.instanceOf(MyData.class);
```
